      <h3>Pimples</h3>
      <p>So you have started noticing small dots on your face filled with this white liquid and can be a bit painful! Well congratulations you have officially unlocked "pimples"</p>
      <p>- Pimples are little bumps filled with pus (the white liquid we mentioned before)</p>
      <p>- Your skin has pores everywhere, and these pores make sebum which is a type of oil. So when your pore makes too much sebum dirt, germs, and bacteria fill up your pore causing the dreadful pimples!</p>
      <h4>How can I treat them?</h4>
      <p>- As much as I know how tempting it can be, DO NOT POP YOUR PIMPLES! You are just gonna end up doing more damage as it can cause scars and infections that can last forever!</p>
      <p>- To avoid pimples all in all it is important that you keep your face nice and clean! Do this by washing your face twice a day with a good quality face wash!</p>
      <p>- Do not touch your face too much. Your hands are the one thing that is home to dirt, germs and bacteria. So by touching your face, you are transferring those germs on your face!</p>
      <p>- Do not use any products with harmful chemicals!</p>
      <p>- Believe it or not, not drinking enough water and eating unhealthy food can also cause pimples! So stay hydrated and maintain a well-balanced diet!</p>

      <h3>Managing Periods</h3>
        <p>Now that we already know a bit about why we girls get our periods, let us go into managing them and how we can maintain good hygiene!</p>
        <p>- Managing all the things on your period can be overwhelming at the start, but with a good set routine, it can be a piece of cake as long as you remain clean! </p>
        <p>- Taking a shower or a bath daily during your period is so important to keep clean! In the shower make sure you clean your vagina properly as it has been covered in blood during your period.</p>
        <p>- As you already know now, the different items you can use to catch your blood include pads, tampons, and even menstrual cups.</p>
        <h4>Using And Disposing Pads Properly</h4>
        <p>- First of all it is important to know that throughout the day it is important to change your pads 3-4 times to avoid any infections in your vagina, and so that area stays clean.</p>
        <p>- So how do you use a pad? Pads come in different shapes and sizes, some come with wings, some are used for a heavy flow, and some for a lighter flow.</p>
        <p>- After using or disposing of pads it is important that you wash your hands with soap!</p>
        <p>- Below is a video on how to use a pad, and how to dispose of one!</p>

      <h3>Body Odour</h3>
            <p>Smelling a little funky? Well you can thank body odour for that!</p>
            <p>- For most kids/teens body odour kicks in during the time of puberty with the hormonal changes however this is different for everyone so it may start later or earlier.</p>
            <h4>Managing Body Odour</h4>
            <p>- Now that we are stuck with body odour, here are some ways to manage it!</p>
            <p>- Using deodorant or antiperspirants helps hide the smell. Deodorants come in different types, for you kids I would recommend sticking to a roll-on or cream rather than going for spray as sprays could cause burns, and get into your eyes if you don't spray properly.</p>
            <p>- Along with that, making sure you wear a clean set of clothes every day is important as there could be growth of germs on them. </p>
            <p>- Daily showers where you really clean yourself with soap properly in all areas especially underarms are another way to avoid body odour.</p>

       <h3>Bad Breath!</h3>
       <p>Oooh! Bad breath is just straight-up gross! No one wants to be that kid with the stinky breath! Don't worry though we got you!</p>
       <p>- Keeping a fresh minty breath is not ALWAYS possible, once in a while everyone can have bad breath. But why does it happen?</p>
       <p>- Let's state the obvious first, you may have eaten something like garlic, onions, or any food or drink that may have caused this.</p>
       <p>- But the other huge cause could be because of your bad oral hygiene. We talked about hygiene in all different body parts, but how about your mouth?</p>
       <h4>Managing Oral Hygiene</h4>
       <p>- Your mouth can be home to heaps of bacteria if you do not keep it clean! </p>
       <p>- Using deodorant or anti-perspirants helps hide the smell. Deodorants come in different types, for you kids I would recommend sticking to a roll-on or cream rather than going for spray as sprays could cause burns, and get into your eyes if you don't spray properly.</p>
       <p>- Start by brushing your teeth twice a day both day and night for 2 minutes (set a timer if that helps!) and also floss with that. That food from dinner will most definitely be stuck in between your teeth! Get it out before bacteria start to grow!</p>
       <p>- Clean your tongue too with a scraper! You may not be doing this regularly but it 100% is a good hygienic habit to keep and may also be the key reason behind your bad breath.</p>
