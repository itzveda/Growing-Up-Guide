    <h3>So what in the world is PUBERTY???</h3>
    <p>Puberty is a natural part of your life! trust me everyone goes through this crazy change in our bodies. So like what even is it? </p>
    <p>Puberty is the time when your body starts to develop and change as it transitions from being a child to an adult. Puberty for girls usually starts around 8 and 13, while boys start puberty at around 9 and 15. But remember it is different for everyone which is totally normal! Some may start earlier or later than others!</p>
    <p>Puberty begins when your bodies start producing a lot of chemicals because of the sex hormones. In boys this is called "testosterone" and in girls, it is "estrogen" and "progesterone"</p>
    <p>Puberty will bring heaps of physical changes and emotional changes in your body which can be similar and different for both boys and girls which we will split below in the page.</p>
    <p>Some of these common changes include feeling strong emotions or another phrase we use for it is having “mood swings.” Some common physical changes you all may experience are growth spurts where you suddenly grow taller, body hair in new places such as underarms and genitals, body odour and many more changes!!!</p>

     <div class="voice-card">
       <div class="info">
         <h5>Deep Voice!</h5>
         <p>- One change that boys may face is a deeper voice.</p>
         <p>- As the boy goes through puberty the voice box becomes larger and the vocal cords become thicker and longer. This voice box is also called the “larynx.”</p>
         <p>- As your body starts to adjust to the starting stages of puberty, your voice may break or crack, but this would only happen for some time. You gotta just wait for the voice box to fully grow and the voice will finally stop making any cracks or breaks.</p>
         <p>- The key thing to keep in mind is that it may be "embarrassing" to have a deeper voice now, but this is just another part of you turning into an adult, and this is all just temporary. </p>

     <div class="hair-card">
       <div class="info">
         <h5>Body Hair!</h5>
         <p>- Another huge change is hair growing in many different parts of your body! </p>
         <p>- Some boys will notice body hair growing in areas such as the chest, arms, legs, face (facial hair), armpits and even by your genitals.</p>
         <p>- This happens to you because of "hormones" which are chemical messengers in your body. Some of these hormones tell the body to start changing and also signal the growth of body hair. </p>

         <h5>Erections And Wet Dreams!</h5>
         <p>- Okay! So erections and wet dreams are things that boys feel a bit more awkward about sharing, but we want to make it super duper clear that this is yet again another normal part of growing up and the world of puberty fella boys!</p>
         <p>- So what are erections? Erections are when the penis hardens as blood flows through it causing it to become bigger and it stands away. </p>
         <p>- Erections can happen for no reason at all! Kind of like your penis having a mind of its own! It could even happen when you are seeing or thinking of something sexual.</p>
         <p>- Now a wet dream is when you release sperm while you are asleep because your body starts creating more of the hormone "testosterone"</p>

    <div class="periods-card">
      <div class="info">
        <h5>Periods! (Menstruation)</h5>
        <p>- The biggest change in a girl's body during puberty is menstruation or periods! Most girls get their period between the ages of 9 to 16. It can start earlier or later either is completely normal.</p>
        <p>- Menstruation is when blood and tissue from your uterus comes out of your vagina. This usually occurs once a month for around 3 to 7 days. </p>
        <p>- Periods happen because the hormones in your body are changing. The ovaries release the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which results in the lining of the uterus which is the place where a baby can grow building up a lining of blood and tissue. If you don't get pregnant your body does not need this lining and it will shed it. This shedding is what causes your period.</p>
        <p>- The blood flow can be different for everyone! Some girls have a heavier flow, while others have a lighter flow, some may also see clumps and clots in the blood which is also totally normal! </p>
        <p>- Some annoying things that come along with your period may be cramps OUCH! You might feel these cramps in your lower back, or belly which are like muscle pains. Some girls also feel tired, moody, or have headaches. </p>
        <p>- Now for managing your periods we have some helpful video tutorials on the personal hygiene page!</p>

      <div class="info">
        <h5>Breast Development!</h5>
        <p>- Ahhh breasts or in other words boobs! As you progress through puberty you will see a development in your breasts! This usually starts around the age of 10 or 11! </p>
        <p>- You may start noticing that the size of your breasts will increase and the shape will start to change. Remember every girl's breast shape and size are different and they also may develop at different times! This is completely normal!</p>
        <p>- At one stage your breasts may also feel sore and tender as they grow.</p>
        <p>- So you may ask....when is the right age for me to start wearing a bra? Once your breasts start growing, wearing a bra can help keep the breasts and tissue supported. Bras come in so many different sizes, you can easily get measured in a clothes department store, or just at home with the help of your mum!</p>
